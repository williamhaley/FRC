# Romi Setup

**These scripts create an unorthodox custom Romi setup. Do not use them without reading and understanding them first.**

This repository contains scripts that will set up the `wpilib-ws-robot-romi` service on a non-WPILib Arm Linux installation. This is **not** FRC/FIRST approved. This is not supported or guaranteed. This lacks key features and niceties.

Updates are not guaranteed. This is meant for tinkerering and a very stripped-down (but functional) simulation/Romi platform for FRC. In my testing, this _does_ work to allow a "normal" RomiReference project to run on a generic Pi.
